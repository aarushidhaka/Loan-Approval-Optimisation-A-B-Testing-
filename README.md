# A/B Testing for AI-Powered Loan Approval System Optimisation

This project evaluates an AI-powered loan approval model using **A/B testing** to assess its impact on financial risk management. The analysis focuses on reducing **Type II errors** (approving bad loans) and improving overall decision accuracy for a consumer lending company.  

The project was part of the *Advanced Data Analysis* module at Warwick Business School.

## üìù Project Overview

- **Objective**: Assess whether an AI model can reduce financial losses from bad loans by minimizing false negatives (Type II errors) and improving loan officer confidence.  
- **Key Features**:
  - Hypothesis testing to compare control and treatment groups.  
  - Metrics: Type I & Type II error improvements, agreement rate, revision rate, confidence scores.  
  - Visualizations: Histograms, density plots, and trend analyses for performance metrics.
